# Ezivi
An attempt to crawl the really bad e-zivi website with C# as the idea was to re-write it in Blazor.
(There were several attemps ranging in complexity. That's why the current code is very minimal)

Unfortunately the E-zivi website loads at most 200 results if the search space is bigger. 
The only way to achieve complete scraping would be to make keyword searches until all entries were found.

Therefor this project is currently on ice though certainly will be picked up sometime in the future.
